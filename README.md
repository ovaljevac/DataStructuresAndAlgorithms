# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, organized into categories for better readability and modular learning. All examples are written with clarity in mind, suitable for both academic and self-learning purposes.

## 📁 Folder Overview

- **Array List & Singly Linked List** – Basic linear data structures with sequential and linked memory allocation.
- **Array Map** – Map implementation using arrays for key-value storage.
- **AVL Tree Map** – Self-balancing binary search tree map implementation.
- **Binary Tree Map** – Standard binary tree-based map structure.
- **Deque** – Double-ended queue structure supporting insertions/deletions from both ends.
- **Directed Graph** – Representation and traversal (DFS/BFS) of directed graphs using adjacency lists.
- **Doubly Linked List** – Linked list allowing traversal in both directions.
- **Hash Map** – Hash table implementation using separate chaining (with lists).
- **Queue** – FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure, both array and linked list-based.
- **Recursion - Fibonacci** – Recursive and dynamic programming approaches to calculating Fibonacci numbers.
- **Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Selection, Quick)** – Common comparison-based sorting algorithms.
- **Sorting (Heap, Radix)** – Non-comparison-based and heap-based sorting methods.
- **Stack** – LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure using arrays or linked lists.

## 🧠 Purpose
